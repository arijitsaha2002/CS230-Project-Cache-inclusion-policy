## Overview
In this Project, we have implemented different inclusion policies (**Inclusive, Exclusive, NINE**).
Along with that we have also evaluated different cache hierarchies by testing it for various Cache Sizes, Cache replacement policies, Cache Inclusion policies, and improving performance for SAT Solver traces.

## Running Instructions
To know, how to run champsim refer this <a href="https://github.com/casperIITB/ChampSim">link</a>.
To run different policies, Go to inc/cache.h and write or uncomment #define {policy}. 
Here {policy} can be replaced by **INCLUSIVE** for inclusive , **EXCLUSIVE** for exclusive and **NON_INCLUSIVE** for NINE.
